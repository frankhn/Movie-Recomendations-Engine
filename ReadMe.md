# Movie Recommendation Engine

A machine learning model for making a recommendation for movies based on user behaviors

## Getting Started

The model users a pre-stored set of data to perform the algorithms on the data set.

### Prerequisites

Some Python and Machine learning understanding is required to get to understand how the engine works.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

You need first Python installed in your local machine 
along with the following packages


```
 pandas, sklearn and numpy
```

## Running the tests on the pre-stored data set

```
 python3 ./recommend.py
 ```
## Built With

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - data analysis
